Hello ajLuna7,

Your project looks good by now. The structure is well organized and you did an excellent job in data wrangling. 

1. Is the project organized modularly, with Make as the workflow manager?
This part has not been finished yet.

2. Does the project use both Python (Pandas specifically) and R (Tidyverse specifically) scripts?
Yes, the author used pandas to do data wrangling and R to visualize.

3. Is Docker used to define execution environments appropriately?
This part has not been finished yet.

4. Are the plots appropriate for the data types, the hypotheses being tested, and the points being communicated?
Yes, the plots make sense to illustrate the data.

5. How can the project be organized or documented more clearly?
The README file could be more specific, like lists the purpose of project and questions to be answered.

6. Is the purpose of the project communicated clearly?
Not yet, the README does not state the purpose clearly.

7. Does the purpose of the project make sense from the clientâ€™s point of view? How could the project better serve the client?
Not sure.

8. Is the source of the data made clear? (Remember that this project can be part of your public portfolios, so people not familiar with UMD may see it).
It could be more clear, like you may introduce UMD briefly.

Some suggestion:

It sounds great that you adopt some external data to explore demographic information across Durham county using spatial data, maybe you could make it more specific when demonstrating data source.
