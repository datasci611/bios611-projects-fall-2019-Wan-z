Project1 for bios 611 of Wan Zhang

## Project introduction

This project is based on a data set provided by Urban Ministries of Durham, which describes the support service they provided to the homeless from 1996 to 2019 (I discarded the data before 1996 and after 2019, and for the cases I analyze the trends of variables I will ignore the data of 2019). The purpose of this project is analyzing the data with R and demonstrate the result to assist UMDâ€™s to provide support more effectively.

## Data description

This study used survey data provided by Urban Ministries of Durham. This data includes 18 variables with 79838 observations, including 
* Date of service being provided
* Family identifier and file merge
* Bus tickets (number of)
* Support in food: Number of people in the family for which food was provided and food pounds
* Clothing items (number of) 
* Financial support

## Research problem
* Tidy the data: removing the empty columns and filter by time
* The frequency of demand in different types of service and the changes of them over time.
* Group the data by date and figure out what to provide in specific periods in one year.
* The changes in demand: how do the number of clients and cases of services change over years.
* Predict the demand in 2019 if it linearly increases.


## Expected results

* Demand for different resources increases and decreases periodically: related to season or other factors.
* The number of clients and cases of services keeps increasing.
