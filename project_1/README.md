## Project introduction

This project is based on a data set provided by Urban Ministries of Durham, which describes the support service they provided to the homeless from 1996 to 2019. The purpose of this project is analyzing the data with R and demonstrate the result to assist UMDâ€™s to provide support more effectively.

## Data description

This study used survey data provided by Urban Ministries of Durham. This data includes 18 variables with 79838 observations.

## Research problem
* Tidy the data: removing the empty columns and filter by time
* Figure out the trends of the services over year and distribution by month.
* The changes in the number of clients and cases of services over years.
* Predict the demand in 2019 if it linearly increases.


## Expected results

* Demand for different resources increases and decreases periodically: related to season or other factors.
* The number of clients and cases of services keeps increasing.
